# policy-evaluation

Sharing code developed in my first-year classes in Policy Evaluation, taught by Prof. Cristine Pinto, as part of my PhD in Economics at Insper.

All code here was obtained and/or adapted from other public pages on the web. My goal is to reproduce the main concepts of evaluation of interventions in a comprehensive way. I'm a hands-on person, so feel free to colaborate if you're like that too!

I write to learn! If you find anything wrong/inconsistent, please let me know! My e-mail address is heitoraol@al.insper.edu.br. Thanks!
